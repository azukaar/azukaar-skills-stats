# Minecraft Mod: Complete Skill Tree Design

## **MAIN SKILL TREES**

### **ASPECT SYSTEM**
The 8 skill trees are organized into 4 distinct aspects that encourage varied gameplay:

- **MINING:** Artisan, Engineer *(XP from mining blocks)*
- **NATURE:** Farmer, Medic *(XP from harvesting crops, breeding animals)*  
- **EXPLORER:** Scholar, Nomad *(XP from discovering biomes/structures/items/blocks)*
- **WARRIOR:** Barbarian, Rogue *(XP from dealing damage to mobs, killing enemies)*

Additionally, each aspect gets XP from using skills from its trees. That XP bonus is higher for Nature, and lower for warrior, to balance the XP gain from gameplay.

## **PARAGON CLASSES** *(Advanced Hybrid Trees)*

### **Paragon Synergy Philosophy**
The four Paragon classes represent the ultimate fusion of complementary base trees, where opposing mechanics create powerful new capabilities:

- **Hunter (Farmer + Barbarian):** Bridges resource production and consumption - Farmers produce plant food while Barbarians consume it for power. Hunters expand this loop by adding sustainable meat production and sharing consumption bonuses with animal companions, creating renewable resource cycles that fuel pack-wide combat effectiveness.

- **Sanguinarian (Medic + Rogue):** Balances healing and health expenditure - Medics heal allies while Rogues spend health for power. Sanguinarians control both sides of this equation across entire teams, creating sophisticated life-sharing networks where healing from violence and strategic health distribution become group-wide tactical resources.

- **Sentinel (Engineer + Nomad):** Merges defense and mobility - Engineers provide resistance but suffer slowness while Nomads offer speed but endure vulnerability windows. Sentinels resolve both weaknesses through mech transformation (combining high resistance with enhanced mobility) or fortress networks (protected teleportation with instant deployment).

- **Artificer (Artisan + Scholar):** Connects creation and knowledge - Artisans spend XP to create enhanced tools while Scholars use tools and knowledge to generate XP. Artificers amplify both cycles through powerful item crafting that transcends normal limitations, creating synergistic loops between tool mastery and XP generation that enable legendary creations.
