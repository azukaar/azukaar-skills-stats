# SENTINEL *(Paragon: Engineer + Nomad)*

## **Overview**
The Sentinel paragon class represents the ultimate fusion of defensive engineering and tactical mobility. These masters of mobile fortification can rapidly establish defensive positions, create teleportation networks, and deploy advanced battlefield technology. The Sentinel offers two distinct ultimate paths: Fortress Commander or Mech Pilot.
