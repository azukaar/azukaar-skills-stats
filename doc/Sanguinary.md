## **Core Philosophy**
The Sanguinarian transforms individual combat and healing into a sophisticated team resource management system. Health becomes a shared commodity, combat abilities become team buffs, and the entire group operates as a single organism with distributed life force control. The key is intelligent distribution - healing goes where it's needed most, damage goes where it can be best absorbed, and powerful abilities can be shared strategically across the network.
